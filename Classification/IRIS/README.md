## Additional Information

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Highly effective for classification tasks, achieving excellent accuracy with clear margins.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A powerful technique that builds models sequentially, optimizing predictions.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A type of neural network that can capture complex relationships in data.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification that can be extended to multi-class problems.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, effective for text classification.
- **Decision Tree**: An interpretable model that splits data into branches to make decisions.
